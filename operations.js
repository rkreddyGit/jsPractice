// We already know how to create variables and how to assign them numbers.
//Now, we will learn how to compare these variables and their values with each other. We can do so by using comparison operators.
//The first operator we explore is the Equal to (==) operator. It checks if two values are equal. For example:

2 == 2;

// Can you guess what the output will be?

const priceOne = 5;
const priceTwo = 10;
console.log(priceOne == priceTwo);

// Here, we used the Equal to (==) operator to check if the values of priceOne and priceTwo are equal.

// Comparison operators always return a boolean value. In this case we got false because priceOne and priceTwo are not equal.

// Now, priceOne and priceTwo have the same value. Let's see what the output will be:

const priceOne = 10;
const priceTwo = 10;
console.log(priceOne == priceTwo);

// The second operator we explore is the Not Equal to (!=) operator. It checks if two values are not equal. For example:
2 != 2;
